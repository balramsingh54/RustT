// as example 
enum computer_language{
    C,  // c , c++ and java is callled varient of computer language 
    C++,   // these all is valure of computer language  
    Java,
}

// lets create instance of each varient it's look like as below

let c = computer_language::C;  //  this is called instance of varient of C++
let C++= computer_language::C++; // this is called instance of varient of C++
let java = coputer_language::Java; // this is called instance of varient of Java
